# LiveOverflow's HopperSort Plugin
Allows Minecraft hoppers to sort items. 

This plugin based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LiveOverflow">LiveOverflow's</a> HopperSorting plugin's code that he showed in one of his videos. 
It uses same logic, the only difference is that it was translated into Kotlin and compiled into a ready to use jar file. 

<h1>How it works?</h1> 
Hoppers simply wont pickup any items that you didn't stated in their name.
 
<h1>How to use? </h1>
Press F3 + H, check items translationKey (minecraft:cobblestone - cobblestone is a translationKey). Rename hopper using an anvil. 

<h1>Wildcards</h1>
You could use * before the translationKey to make it a wildcard, wildcard searches the line at the start of a translationKey or and the end of it.
