# LivesOverflowHopperSort Plugin
Allows Minecraft hoppers to sort items. 

This thing based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LiveOverflow">LivesOverflow</a> HopperSorting plugin's code that he showed in one of his videos. 
It uses same logic, the only difference is that its translated into Kotlin and was compiled into a runnable jar file. 

<h1>How it works?</h1> 
- Hoppers simply wont pickup any items that you didn't stated in their name. 
- 
<h1>How to use? </h1>
Press F3 + H, check items translationKey (minecraft:cobblestone - cobblestone is a translationKey).
Rename hopper using an anvil. 
Wildcards - you could use * before the translationKey to make it a wildcard, wildcard searches the line at the start of a translationKey or and the end of it.
